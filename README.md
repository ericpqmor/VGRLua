# Vector-Graphics-Renderer
This is the last assignment implementation code for IMPA's 2D Computer Graphics course. It was made using Shortcut Tree as an acceleration datastructure. The low-level code was made by Diego Nehab (IMPA).

The png.lua (Implementation itself) and the other debug tools were made by Eric Moreira, Joaquin del Priore and Leonardo Ferreira.

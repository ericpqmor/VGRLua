On Windows, do not use the makefile.
First, download all precompiled libraries from the course page (vc14.zip).
Expand the vc14.zip to some directory.
(Warning, icu is a gigantic lib. This will unpack to 1GB of data.)
Modify paths.props to reflect where you expanded vc14.zip.
Then, open the solution file (vg.sln) provided with Visual Studio 2015.
When running, I suggest you use git-bash.
When input and output is to console, prefix calls to Lua with with winpty.

For Linux and Mac OS, please read the makefile for further instructions.
